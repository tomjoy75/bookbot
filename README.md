# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It analyzes a book text file and prints word and character statistics.

## Usage

```bash
mkdir books
# Put your text files (e.g., .txt books) inside the 'books' directory

python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```
Example output:
```bash
============ BOOKBOT ============
Analyzing book found at books/frankenstein.txt...
----------- Word Count ----------
Found 78,421 total words
--------- Character Count -------
a: 12804
b: 1978
...
============= END ===============
```
